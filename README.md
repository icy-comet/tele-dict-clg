## ðŸ“– Bring Dictionary to Your Telegram ðŸ¤–

A afternoon-project born out of boredom. Yet, fully functional and deployable.

The code isn't totally bullet-proof, though.

## Configuration âš™

#### Dependencies
Simply run the following command in a virtual environment:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Environment Variables

- Your Telegram bot's access token should be set as `BOT-TOKEN` environment variable.

Put it in a `.env` file for local development:

```
BOT_TOKEN=<your-token-here>
```
